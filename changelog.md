# -----{ 1.0.0-alpha.15 }-----
- It's a brand-new mod.

### Notable Highlights:
- Apiaries are no longer a multiblock and have their own inventory. They also no longer have the unique bee requirement and can hold up to 20 bees at T4
- The Breeder now has its own inventory and is separate from the apiary.
- Honey Generator is now recipe driven and can be upgraded.
- Centrifuge multiblock can be confusing at first but can also become a very powerful multiblock. In a general sense, it's like taking a bunch of small multiblocks and turning them into one large one. It can be very simple, or it can be very complex. You decide!
- We will be making a video guide on using the Centrifuge multiblock very soon, which should be very helpful in using it.
- There is a `/resourcefulbees` command which you can use to print json templates to the logs. The command isn't complete, but can get you started. Feel free to ask questions in Discord!
- Bees have significantly more customization options than they did in 1.16.5.
- _Most_ jsons are datapack driven.
- Machines are all recipe driven.

#### Please keep in mind this mod is still in alpha. There can and likely will be more breaking changes, and as such the mod should only be included in packs if you accept the risks.
#### We are releasing this publicly in such an early state because we would like to get more feedback from the community. We need to know what you like and don't like. What bugs are there? What is confusing and should be clarified better? How can we improve and make this mod the best bee mod there is?
